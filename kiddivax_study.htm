<h3><a name="overview">1. Study overview</a></h3>

<p>While vaccination is known to be effective in reducing
  influenza-related morbidity in school-age children it is
  not currently recommended in Hong Kong because few
  infections in this age group above 2 years result in
  significant morbidity or mortality. Also, the supply of
  vaccines is limited and indirect costs of vaccination
  are high.</p>

<p>However, evidence from randomized trials, observational
  studies and modeling studies has accumulated which
  suggests that the vaccination of school-age children can
  provide substantial indirect benefits to the rest of the
  community, particularly to older adults who are most at
  risk for the complications associated with influenza.
  This approach to vaccination is known as the
  "transmission-limiting" strategy, in contrast to the current
  "morbidity-limiting" approach where those individuals at
  highest risk of complications are targeted to receive the
  vaccine.</p>

<p>While the indirect benefits of vaccinating school-age
  children against influenza have been extensively studied
  at the community level, relatively few studies have investigated
  whether vaccination of school-age children can lead to indirect
  benefits at the household level, to the parents or siblings
  of vaccinees.</p>
  
<p>In 2008-09 (pilot) and 2009-10 (main study) we conducted a
  double-blind randomized controlled trial of households in Hong Kong,
  where one child aged 6-17 from each household was randomized to
  receive either one dose of trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza
  vaccine, or saline placebo. Each household was followed up for
  around a year, with serum drawn from each household member before
  and after the study, and also from some participants during the
  study. Subjects and household contacts were asked to keep daily
  symptom diaries, and during episodes of acute respiratory illness in
  any household member we arranged to collect nose and throat swabs
  from all household members regardless of illness for laboratory
  confirmation of influenza infection.</p>

<h3><a name="pilot">3. Pilot findings</a></h3>

<p>The primary findings from the 2008-09 pilot study were published by

2010, Clin Infect Dis">Cowling et al. (2010, Clin Infect Dis)</a>.
In brief, the pilot study achieved its aim of confirming the
feasibility of the main study design, provided some information
about the incidence of influenza infections and illnesses, and
provided primary evidence of temporary immunity. We found no evidence
of indirect benefits although with only 119 households our pilot
study was underpowered to detect even fairly large indirect effects.</p>

<h3><a name="trans">4. Transmissibility of influenza in households</a></h3>

<p>We analyzed the final outbreak size distributions of pH1N1, sH1N1, sH3N2 infections identified in paired sera 
collected from 117 Hong Kong households in April and in August-October 2009. The results were published by 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206962/">Klick et al. (2011, Epidemiology)</a>. In conclusion, pandemic and seasonal influenza A viruses had similar age-specific 
transmissibility in a cohort of initially uninfected households, after adjustment for baseline immunity.</p>

<h3><a name="resp">5. Increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infections</a></h3>

<p>We randomized 115 children to TIV or placebo group. TIV recipients had an increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infections over the following nine months. 
While being protected against influenza, TIV recipients may lack of temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses. The results were published 
by <a href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/03/13/cid.cis307.short">Cowling et al. (2012, Clin Infect Dis)</a>.</p>

2012, Clin Infect Dis">Cowling et al. (2012, Clin Infect Dis)</a>.
In the main study, we recruited 796 children as well as their household members. Pandemic A(H1N1) circulated at the time of vaccination and for a short time 
afterward with no substantial seasonal influenza activity during that period. We found that seasonal TIV prevented pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 
and influenza B infections in children.</p>

<h3><a name="antibody">7. Humoral antibody response after receipt of TIV</a></h3>

<p>Among 119 children recruited in the pilot study, 64 children rejoined the main study and allocation of TIV/placebo in year 2 was independent of allocation in year 1. 
<a href="http://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/2012/09000/Humoral_Antibody_Response_After_Receipt_of.24.aspx">Ng et al. (2012, Pediatr Infect Dis J)</a> studied those 64 subjects 
and suggested that humoral antibody response to TIV may be lower in children receiving repeated vaccination, but receipt of TIV induced seroprotection in most subjects.</p>

<h3><a name="immu">8. The effect of age and recent vaccination history on the efficacy of 2009-10 seasonal TIV</a></h3>

<p>There is some evidence that annual vaccination of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) may lead to reduced vaccine immunogenicity but evidence is lacking on whether 
vaccine efficacy is affected by prior vaccination history. <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0059077">Ng et al. (2013, PLoS ONE)</a> investigated on the 796 children recruited in the main study, whose influenza vaccination history 
in the two preceding years was recorded. Ng concluded that prior vaccination was associated with lower antibody responses to TIV against seasonal influenza A vaccine viruses, but 
higher responses to the same lineage of influenza B virus.</p>

<h3><a name="aprot">9. The association between antibody titers and protection against influenza</a></h3>

<p>Antibody titers measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) correlate with protection against influenza virus infection and are used to specify criteria for vaccine licensure. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3778972/">Ng et al. (2013, JID)</a> investigated on the 773 children recruited in the main study with HAI titers available, and found that HAI titers of 1:40 against A(H1N1)pdm09 and B(Victoria lineage) were associated with 48% and 55% protection against PCR-confirmed infection with each strain.</p>

<h3><a name="comment">A comment on reproducible research</a></h3>

<p>We fully support the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0b013e318196784a">increasing calls</a>
from the academic community for 
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwj093" title="Peng et al., 2006, AJE">epidemiologic analyses to be reproducible</a>,
and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1745-6215-10-17" title="Hrynaszkiewicz and Altman, 2009, Trials">raw data from randomized controlled trials to be published</a>, as a part of the wider scientific endeavour to
replicate results.
Another example of this recommendation is in the <a
href="http://www.qve-goodpracticeguide.org.uk/guide#TOC-2.4-Inputs">Good
Practice Guide for Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiology</a>. 
Here we have published the raw <em>anonymised</em> data from our HK vaccination
pilot study, and will later release the data from our main study. We have also published
scripts which allow the analyses in our published papers to be reproduced.</p>

<p>Thousands of local people have given their time, and their families', as part of their
participation in our studies,
all in the expectation that our research studies will add to medical and scientific knowledge.
Participants should also expect that we will make the best possible use of the information that
we have collected about them. It would be difficult to argue that facilitating
best use of the data by the research community need not involve releasing raw data.</p>

<p>Publication of anonymised raw data has been approved by our local IRB and funding sources,
and participants were advised that anonymised data would be published during the informed consent
process. We anticipate that release of the raw data will:</p>
<ul class="circle">
 <li>Promote reproducibility of our results.
 <li>Allow other investigators to conduct their own analyses on our data.
 <li>Allow other investigators to compare our data with theirs, for
   example to explore similarities and differences between research findings.
 <li>Allow other investigators to prepare and plan for their own studies.
